# STA243-Final-SGD-Normality


The details of the Rupert-Polyak SGD averaging proof of normality are filled in.


A simulation is performed in Python to examine SGD estimator distributions at various step size decays rates. We find that deviation from the theoretically sound values leads to different outcomes in SGD estimator distributions.
